CIS 122 - Introduction to Python Programming
----

### Class Details

* Location: online
* Dates:  9/23/2024 - 12/11/20124
* Instructor: Brenden West | BWest@pierce.ctc.edu
* Credits: 5
* Prerequisites: CIS 121 and Math&107 or higher, both with a grade of 2.0 or higher, or instructor permission

#### Summary

This class introduces basic concepts of computer programming with practical exercises using the Python programming language. Students will learn to: 

* Create expressions that use data variables, arithmetic, and logical operators
* Use conditional statements, loops, functions & objects 
* Use proper syntax and design guidelines when writing a computer program
* Apply programming concepts to solve a variety of logical problems

#### Required Materials

Readings will draw from http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/ and http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/. A hardcopy of Think Python is optional, but an excellent reference with exercises and chapter summaries.

Students will also need the following:

* A computer with Python 3.11 or later installed 
* A modern, syntax-highlighting text editor  
* A user account at https://replit.com/
* An account at https://www.codestepbystep.com/ (using your Pierce College email)

### Class Structure and Topics

Each week, we'll cover a different topic, building on the previous week's work. In general, we will cover new material in Tuesday lectures and use Wednesday labs to practice what youâ€™ve learned. We will cover the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

- Intro to Computer Science & Python programming
- Primitive data types & expressions
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Functions
- Strings & file processing
- Data Arrays
- Classes & Objects oriented programming
- Graphics

### Grading

Grades will be based on weekly assignments (85%) & 3 quizzes (15%).

Weekly assignments will be posted on Canvas each Monday and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week. Assignments are due by the end of the week, and late assignments may be automatically marked down by 10%.   

You may discuss how to approach a problem with other students in the class, but your submission must be your own work. Code submissions that are substantially identical would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during the specified time frame to receive credit.
