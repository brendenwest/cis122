#### Summary

This class introduces basic concepts of computer programming with practical exercises using the Python programming language. Students will learn to: 

* Create expressions that use data variables, arithmetic, and logical operators
* Use conditional statements, loops, functions & objects 
* Use proper syntax and design guidelines when writing a computer program
* Apply programming concepts to solve a variety of logical problems

#### Required Materials

There is no required textbook for this course. Readings will draw from several freely available resources such as https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/

Students who prefer a reference book can optionally purchase [Murach’s Python Programming (2nd Edition)](https://www.murach.com/shop/murach-s-python-programming-2nd-edition-detail)

Students will also need the following:
* A computer with Python 3.11 or later installed 
* A modern, syntax-highlighting text editor  
* A user account at https://replit.com/
* An account at https://www.codestepbystep.com/ (using your Pierce College email)

### Class Structure and Topics

Each week, we'll cover a different topic, building on the previous week's work. In general, we will cover new material in Tuesday lectures and use Wednesday labs to practice what you’ve learned. We will cover the following topics, although the order and precise list is subject to revision:

- Intro to Computer Science & Python programming
- Primitive data types & expressions
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- Functions
- Strings & file processing
- Data Arrays
- Classes & Objects oriented programming
- Graphics

### Grading

Grades will be based on weekly assignments (85%) & 3 quizzes (15%).

Weekly assignments will be posted on Canvas each Monday and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week. Assignments are due by the end of the week. 

Late work submitted within 2 weeks of the due date is subject to a 10% grade penalty. Work submitted more than 2 weeks after the due date will not be accepted or graded

You may discuss how to approach a problem with other students in the class, but your submission must be your own work. Code submissions that are substantially identical would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during the specified time frame to receive credit.
