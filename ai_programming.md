### What is AI?

`Artificial Intelligence` (AI) is a catch-all term for computer programs that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.
- Data analysis & predictions
- Natural language processing - understanding written & spoken language
- Computer vision - understanding images and video
- Generative AI - programmatically generating content (text, images, video

Common uses of AI include:
- Chatbots & assistants
- Fraud & error detection
- Self-driving cars (& robots, drones, etc.)

AI sometimes refers to algorithmic techniques that support the above outcomes, such as:
- `Machine Learning` - computer program learns complex patterns from data with little or no human direction.
- `Deep Learning` - computer program that learns by simulating neural networks in brains of living animals
