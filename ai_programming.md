### What is AI?

`Artificial Intelligence` (AI) is a catch-all term for computer programs that perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence.
- Data analysis & predictions
- Natural language processing - understanding written & spoken language
- Computer vision - understanding images and video
- Generative AI - programmatically generating content (text, images, video

Common uses of AI include:
- Chatbots & assistants
- Fraud & error detection
- Self-driving cars (& robots, drones, etc.)

AI sometimes refers to algorithmic techniques that support the above outcomes, such as:
- `Machine Learning` - computer program learns complex patterns from data with little or no human direction.
- `Deep Learning` - computer program that learns by simulating neural networks in brains of living animals

### AI-assisted Programming

### Risks of AI-assisted Programming

Despite the many benefits of AI-assistance, aspiring computer programmers should be aware of the risks.

The first, most obvious risk for students is a failed grade for `plagiarism` when submitting work that isn't their own. Teachers have access to a number of tools that can detect AI-generated assigment submissions.

Some other risks are:

- **Code Quality** - AI models can be trained on incorrect or out-dated information and have no understanding of whether the input is correct. Code generated from these models can be full of mistakes or mis-guidance.
- 
- **Dependence on AI** - Programmers who depend on AI-generated code can lose their ability to evaluate or even understand the code.

- **Intellectual Property (IP)** - 

An AI model might have been trained on copyrighted material, so programmers using AI-generated code in their product can be at risk of lawsuits.

Also, ownership of AI-generated code is not yet defined and programmers could lose ownership of programs where they used output of AI tools.

Programmers also risk providing confidential information to the AI system in violation of company policy, which is then disclosed to competitors.

- **Privacy** - Similar to IP, programmers risk providing information to an AI system in violation of privacy laws.
- **Algorithmic bias** - programmers can't really know how an AI model was trained and what incorrect data or stereotypes it perpetuates.
